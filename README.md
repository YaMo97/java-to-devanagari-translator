Eclipse Plugin for translating English Java Code into Devanagari (Hindi Language)

## Objective
To develop a plugin for Eclipse IDE which translates Java Code written in English Language into Devanagari Language and vica-versa.

##### What is the purpose of this plugin?
As we all know, the population of India is around 1.2 billion nowadays, and the Hindi language is the most spoken language in India with user base of around 50% of the total popultaion. 
The purpose of this plugin is to make programming in Java accessible to people who prefer their native language of Hindi above English language. This will enable many Indians and other Hindi users all over the world to understand and code in Java.
This will also make java accessible to the children studying in Hindi Medium Schools and enable them to learn Programming and as a result help in reducing the gap between English and Hindi Programmers.

##### Desired Result
Following is an Example Java Code written in English Language: -
```
class HelloWorld 
{ 
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
        System.out.println("Hello, World"); 
    } 
} 
```
After translating to Devanagari Script (Hindi) the code will be: - 
```
कक्षा हैलो_वर्ल्ड
{
    सार्वजनिक स्थैतिक शून्य main (स्ट्रिंग [] आर्गस[])
    {
        सिसतम.आउट.प्रिंटएलन("हैलो, वर्ल्ड");
    }
}
```
